# Excel-Inventory-To-Simplified-Model-View-EXI_SMV
A First Year 2nd Semester OOP Project in CPE 009 | An Inventory Project Based on Python Object Oriented Programming using Kivy Framework with Material Design Theme from KivyMD Various Repository. Designed To Convert Excel Row and Column Views into Simplified List with Controls for Quick Actions. Data Looped from SQL to Excel or vice versa...


## Introduction / Information
Inventory To Simplified Model View was one of my second projectin programming that only circulates in Python. It was coded in Object Oriented which is different than the first project which uses the method of Procedural Programming. Our goal is to make an application that is responsive, carefully design which includes friendly interface. With that, we were able to achieve one thing. Is to create an application that simplifies excel data into a list view which sorts data for proper editing. Which is made to reduce confusion and fatigue as well...

There is a contribution, please wait for it...

## Versioning
We use don't use any APIs regarding software versioning. But instead we usually do based on time and date in 24H format. For example:
```
When Build is Done: at 4:51 PM at 08/21/2018
Result Versioning is: 1651-082118.BETA
```
I (Janrey Licas), would like to use some other revisioning naming other than my method of versioning...

# Unconventional FAQ
## Why would you like to distribute this?
  - I don't meant to distribute this for any use of any projects, that should be asked with permission on me. But since this was open source, people won't do that with respect. However, I make this project open for public to make Kivy gain popularity and especially make KivyMD alive to make things if possible, make the development goes back into a state of the way it should be...
  
## Any chances of being a maintainer of the project 'KivyMD'???
  - There might be chances that I want to apply, ever since I love Material Design so much, that I use it on overall design- dependent contents such as PowerPoint and GUI Programming. But in any possible conflict on the changes of the component, I will make one for myself or contribute to one of the following:
 ```
 Potential repos #1: AndreMiras/KivyMD
 Potential repos #2: HeaTTheatR/KivyMD
 ```
This project won't go alive because of these forked-from-official repos. - 'Janrey "CodexLink" Licas
