# Excel Inventory To Simplified Model View | EXI_SMV
A First Year 2nd Semester OOP Project in CPE 009 | An Inventory Edit Project Based on Python Object Oriented Programming using Kivy Framework with Material Design Theme from KivyMD Various Repository. Designed To Convert Excel Row and Column Views into Simplified ListView Model with Controls for Quick Actions. Program is Excel File Dependent.

## Introduction / Information
Inventory To Simplified Model View was one of my second projectin programming that only circulates in Python. It was coded in Object Oriented which is different than the first project which uses the method of Procedural Programming. Our goal is to make an application that is responsive, carefully design which includes friendly interface. With that, we were able to achieve one thing. Is to create an application that simplifies excel data into a list view which sorts data for proper editing. Which is made to reduce confusion and fatigue as well...

## Getting Started

These instructions that will help you get  a copy of our project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

Here are the things that you need to install the software. Each software has labelled it's difficulty on how to use it.

```
PROGRAM NAME

 - Visual Stutio Code (Dependent IDE), Install Dependencies Such as KivyLang, Kivy, Python, Code Runner, MagicPython and Python Extension Packs

Collaboration
VS Live Share - You need aspiring or willing groupmates to use this one.
Github Desktop, Git GUI and Git Bash - Alternative Collaboration Than Usual File Passing - Intermediate
Discord - For Screen Share and Talk about Development

```
## Deployment
There are two ways to deploy, one is non friendly and one executable
```
For Non Friendly, extract the files and run the script with files exposed.
For Exectuable, extract the files and run the executable with files exposed.

But since this is too much exposing source code, we can achieve deploying this application by compiling pyInstaller with 'One-File' File. Further Tutorial will be placed sometime.
```

## Builderspec Docs Instructions for One File System (Except Data)
```
Will be releasing this method next time/
```

## Built With
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - The primary text editor with Github Integration and other such stuffs. Secondary Compiler and Debugger, best.
* [Python](https://www.python.org/) - Main Language Used for creating this amazing program.
* [Kivy](http://kivy.org) - A framework that is usable from PC to Android.
* [KivyMD (HeaTheatR)](https://github.com/HeaTTheatR/KivyMD) - First Kivy Theme Source with Updated Components
* [KivyMD (AndreMiras)] (https://github.com/AndreMiras/KivyMD) - Second Kivy Theme Source with Minimal Components Updated

## Versioning
We use don't use any APIs regarding software versioning. But instead we usually do based on time and date in 24H format. For example:
```
When Build is Done: at 4:51 PM at 08/21/2018
Result Versioning is: 1651-082118.BETA
```
I (Janrey Licas), would like to use some other revisioning naming other than my method of versioning...

# Unconventional FAQ
## Why would you like to distribute this?
  - I don't meant to distribute this for people who likes to take projects and use it as a whole as their project without any credit, that should be asked with permission on me. But since this was open source, people won't do that with respect as I assume. However, I make this project open for public to make Kivy gain popularity and especially make KivyMD alive to make things and if possible, make the development goes back into a state of the way it should be...
  
## Any chances of being a maintainer of the project 'KivyMD'???
  - There might be chances that I want to apply, ever since I love Material Design so much, that I use it on overall design-dependent contents such as PowerPoint and GUI Programming. But in any possible conflict on the changes of the component, I will make one for myself or contribute to one of the following:
 ```
 Potential repos #1: AndreMiras/KivyMD
 Potential repos #2: HeaTTheatR/KivyMD
 ```
This projects won't go alive because of these forked-from-official repos. But still in the end, I'm not too sure- 'Janrey "CodexLink" Licas

## Will you be maintaining this project?
 -  Nice Question. No, I will be making another one with its objective that is personal of mine. Also it is pain in the ass for me to do all layouting without a designer. I will be try switching to PyQt 5 looking for material design. But let's see how it goes.
